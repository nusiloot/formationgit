Linux Kernel, Python, PHP, Perl, Ubuntu ...

Over 31 millions open source projets

Utilised by over 12 millions developpers

Even used by Microsoft ;-)

## Decentralized

* Not a « client / server » architecture</li>
* Every user is a repository</li>
* Versionning knowledge stored localy</li>
* Storage and sharing are separated</li>

## Benefits of the decentralization

* Easier to deploy
* Conflits and merges are core
* Allow diversity of usages
* Better independance
* Allow offline work
